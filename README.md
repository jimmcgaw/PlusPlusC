# C++ Project Configurationo

Despite the name of this repo, I'm currently using this project to learn the <a href="https://cmake.org/" target="_blank">CMake build system</a>.

To run all preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker:

```
make go
```

To run preprocessor and compiler:

```
make compile
```

To scorch the earth (ie empty the `build/` directory):

```
make clean
```

To run:

```
make run
```
